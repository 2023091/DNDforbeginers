<h4>So the big and angry barbarian caught your fancy. Well then let us harness your rage together and charge into battle.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Lets go over the base features of the barbarian that you will recive at level 1: </h4>

<h4>Hit Points: </h4>
<h4>1d12 per level is the biggest hit die available letting you be a walking, 
talking, raging tank able to take damage and dish out twice as much.</h4>

<h4>Saves: </h4>
<h4>Strength saves are fairly rare, but Constitution saves are common and typically very problematic.</h4>

<h4>Proficiencies: </h4>
<h4>Medium armor and martial weapons will get you a long way, but you get no tool proficiencies, and only two skills.</h4>

<br>

<h4> L1) stands for the level you unlock this so L1) means level 1</h4>

<h4>L1) Rage: </h4>
<h4>Rage is the Barbarian’s defining class feature. 
You enter a rage state as a bonus action and gain the following bonus's as long as you arnt wearing heavy armour.
Resistance to bludgening, piercing and slashing damage. This makes you much more tough and survive much longer.
You can rage multiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but you can also keep your rage going as long as you either make an attack roll or take damage before the start of your next turn.
Your number of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid it.</h4>

<h4>L1) Unarmored Defense: </h4>
<h4>Unarmored Defense is great flavour for barbarians, running into battle in a rage in just some simple rags with only theyre muscles to protect them instead of heavy armour like other classes. 
Instead of just adding your dex to your ac you can also add your con modifier using this feature.</h4>

<h4>L2) Reckless Attack: </h4>
<h4>For one turn, you can make all Strength-based melee attacks with advantage. 
When you use Reckless Attack 
enemies have advantage on attack rolls against you until the barbarian's next turn.
Rage makes you resistant to damage from normal weapons (Magical weapons which do weird damage types still work fine), 
so advantage on attacks against you doesn’t matter as much. Go crazy. Kill all of the things. 
Reckless Attack also makes using oversized weapons viable under some circumstances.</h4>

<h4>L2) Danger Sense: </h4>
<h4>You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, 
giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. 
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, 
such as traps and spells.</h4>

<h4>L3) Primal Path: </h4>

<h4>When hitting level three you select your subclass, Barbarian subclasses are called paths, 
these are how you focus your rage to help you in battle.
I will briefly summarized below some of the notable paths that I belive are good for new players both in a gameplay sense and a rolepay sense.</h4>

<h4>Ancestral Guardian lets you conjure up the spirits of your ancestors to defend yourself and your allies in battle.
Use your guardian to shield your allies from harm and force your enemies to fight you instead of the puny wizard. </h4>

<h4>Storm Herald offers a lot of customizability as a nature-themed Barbarian, 
adding features thematically tied to your choice of Environment,
which you can change every time you gain a level. Choose between Desert, Sea or Tundra 
and tie it into your backstory to create a powerful and intresting character. </h4>

<h4>Totem Warrior is commonly known as one of the toughest barbarian subclasses. 
You customise your barbarian with Animal-themed benefits as you level up, allowing you to customize your barbarian to fill several roles in combat. 
Its toughness is good for new players who may not be very good at combat as it allows you to make mistakes with less risk of dying if you take the totem of the bear at level 3.</h4>

<h4>Wild Magic is a gamblers wet dream in a subclass. 
You throw unpredictable magic into the mix gaining a randomly buff every time you rage, 
allowing you to do fantastic things like teleporting in combat. 
As you level you gain the chance to have even more magical and powerful effects happen and even gaining a little control over what effects you gat. </h4>

<br>

<h4>L5) Extra Attack: </h4>

<h4> Make a second attack when you use the attack action. 
Two attacks means potentially twice as much damage in a turn, twice as likely to hit a highly armoured foe and 
twice as much opportunity to apply your rage bonus to damage. </h4>

<h4>L5) Fast Movement: </h4>

<h4>Starting at 5th level, 
your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor to help you chase down and kill your enemies.
</h4>

<h4>L7)Feral Instinct </h4>

<h4>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls. 
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, 
you can act normally on your first turn, 
but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn. </h4>

<h4>L9)Brutal Critical:  </h4>

<h4>When you hit a critical hit you can roll an extra damage die when your using a melee weapon. This will help your big moments be even cooler and make you deal even more damage to your enemies. </h4>

<br>

<h4>Simple Character Ideas you can use: </h4>

<h4>Orphan who lost their parents to a fearsom enemy and is forever angry because of it because the monster got away so you swore revenge. </h4>

<h4>An adventurer who in addicted to battle, your rage is your blood fury and love for battle coming out as you get into the fight. </h4>

<h4>An corrupt king forced your soulmate to marry his son the prince, stealing her away from you. Your now training to get strong enough to beat them while also learning to channel your rage to fuel your rage.</h4>
