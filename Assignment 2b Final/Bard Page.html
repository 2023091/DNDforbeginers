<h4>So the musical and charismatic bard charmed you into playing him? Well lets grab your lute and guitar and get this show started!</h4>

<br>

<h4>Lets go over the base features of the bard that you will recive at level 1: </h4>

<h4>Hit Points: </h4>
<h4>1d8 per level is fantastic for a full casting class, 
but you’re not going to survive rushing into melee all the time so best to tr and avoid it.</h4>

<h4>Saves: </h4>
<h4>Dexterity is great for avoiding fireballs, 
but most spells which call for Reflex saves won’t outright disable you, 
and Charisma saves are extremely rare but can save you from being charmed against your will.</h4>

<h4>Proficiencies: </h4>
<h4>Light armor and a handful of weapons won’t give you a ton of options, but you will mostly be using spells so thats not an issue.
The real strength comes from you getting three skills of your choice, 
which opens up a lot of really great options for you.</h4>

<h4>The Bard is a full caster like a Cleric or Wizard, and casts spells based on their Charisma. 
Bards use a “spells known” mechanic similar to a Sorcerer, 
so your abilities are limited to the spells you know. 
You can replace one spell known every level, 
so don’t worry if you choose a spell at low level and it doesn’t remain useful as you gain levels. 
You can learn new spells every level and you can see how many spells you know on the bards "spells known" list.  </h4>

<br>

<h4>L1) stands for the level you unlock this so L1) means level 1</h4>

<h4>L1) Bardic Inspiration: </h4>
<h4>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. 
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. 
That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. 
Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one 
ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes.</h4>

<h4>L2) Jack of All Trades: </h4>
<h4>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, 
to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.</h4>

<h4>L2) Song of Rest: </h4>
<h4>If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, 
each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</h4>

<h4>L3) Bard College: </h4>

<h4>When hitting level three you select your subclass, Bard subclasses are called colleges, 
these are how you focus your musical or charismatic skills to help your allies.
I will briefly summarized below some of the notable colleges that I belive are good for new players both in a gameplay sense and a rolepay sense.</h4>

<h4>College of Valor adds some martial capabilities to your Bard, 
including medium armor, shields, martial weapons, and Extra Attack. 
Great for when you want to be able to fight with a sword in one hand and a harmanica in the other.</h4>

<h4>College of Eloquence is the best bard that ever did bard. 
College of Eloquence reinforces and expands upon the Bard’s core class features. 
While it doesn’t add anything truly new to the class, 
it does make the Bard’s core features considerably better. 
This is commonly known as a very powerful subclass for social encounters 
so if you are wanting a more balance and fair time it might be best to go another subclass.</h4>

<h4>College of Spirits lets you jam out with the spirits of the dead to empower yourself and allies and defeat your enemies. 
Want to play a bard who learned from the dead masters like fantasy Mozart? 
Then College of Spirits might be for you.</h4>

<h4>College of Whispers are for those of you who want an excuse to play the Mission Impossible soundtrack while sneaking into the villains lair. 
They are great at disguises and deception, College of Whispers is great in a campaign 
with a lot of intrigue and sneaking around, but not a lot of dungeon crawling. </h4>


<h4>L3) Expertise: </h4> 

<h4>Expertise is always fantastic as it lets you choose 2 of your proficent skills and add your proficency modifier twice to it.</h4>

<h4>L5) Font of Inspiration: </h4>

<h4>From 5th level onwards you can now regain all your uses of bardic inspiration on a short rest not just a long rest. </h4>

<h4>L6)Countercharm: </h4>

<h4>You gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. 
As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. 
During which time you and your any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. 
A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. 
The effect ends early if you stop performing or if you are silenced or if you simply choose to end it.</h4>

<h4>L10)Expertise:  </h4>

<h4>You can now choose two more skills to gain expertise in. </h4>

<br>

<h4>Simple Character Ideas you can use: </h4>

<h4>A traveing performer that secretly charms crowds with theyre music to get them to "donate" more gold to them. </h4>

<h4>A musician who travels the world to try and become famous for theyre music and simply becomes an advenurer for the fun on it. </h4>

<h4>A charming and witty speaker who hides theyre pain of a traumatising past behind a mask of smiles and jokes.</h4>
