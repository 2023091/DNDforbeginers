<h4>So you wish to be the holy praying, power of god weilding, invincible healing cleric do you? Well grab your holy symbol, finish your morning prayers and lets go smite some heratics!</h4>

<br>

<h4>Lets go over the base features of the cleric that you will recive at level 1: </h4>

<h4>Hit Points: </h4>
<h4>1d8 per level is good for a full casting class, 
but youll probably need it because being the healer of the group means running into danger occasionally to save your friends. </h4>

<h4>Saves: </h4>
<h4>Wisdom and Charisma are two great saves to have for resisting spells and magical effects. 
You may not be the strongest to break free of your enemy or the quickest to dodge out of the way tho so be careful.</h4>

<h4>Proficiencies: </h4>
<h4>Light armor and medium armor means you can be a quiet and quick healer able to sneak in with the rogue 
or you can have a sheet of metal stuck to your chest and run in with the barbarian praying to keep them alive.
You can also use any simple weapon and a shield to defend yourself in a fight so you can be a healer and a harmer.
Add and two skill Proficiencies and your ready to go.</h4>

<h4>Your god or goddess has bestowed magic on to you and has given you the ability to use spells. You cast your spells using your wisdom modifier.</h4>

<h4>Cantrips are the lowest level spell and as such can be casted an infinite amount of times. 
You know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list at level 1. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels.</h4>

<h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>

<h4>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. 
To cast one of these spells you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. 
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</h4>

<h4>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. 
When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier plus your cleric level (minimum of one spell). 
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
You also have some spells always preppared from your subclass, 
these do not count towards your maximum amount of spells you can know.</h4>

<h4>Divine Domain</h4>

<h4>Cleric subclasses are called domains and they represent both the type of cleric you are and the type of god you worship. 
You choose one domain related to your deity. 
Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. 
It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, 
and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</h4>

<h4>Grave Domain clerics guard the line between life and death. 
The Grave domain makes you the ultimate warrior against the undead while also helping you to protect those you love from moving on to the other side or at least staying there with revival revival spells. </h4>

<h4>Life Domain clerics are the iconic healers of dnd. 
On your watch no one will die thanks to your supreme healing abilities.
This domain boosts the healing you do both for others and to yourself letting you live to heal another day. </h4>

<h4>Light Domain lets you praise the sun and then immediatly after blast your foes with fire and radiant damage. 
If you want to be able to throw holy fireballs as a cleric and blind your foes with holy light then this is the subclass for you.</h4>

<h4>War Domain is direct and simple, fight, blood, pray. 
Whether your on the side of good as a hero or an evil cleric that only lives for battle is up to you. 
Whats assured tho is that unlike most clerics you wont be hiding in the backline, 
youll be front and center right up in your enemies faces as you beat your enemies heads in.</h4>

<br>

<h4>L1) stands for the level you unlock this so L1) means level 1</h4>

<h4>L2) Channel Divinity: </h4>
<h4>You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. 
You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. 
Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description. 
You can use your channel divinity once in the beggining but gain more uses as you level up at levels 6 and 18.</h4>

<h4>Turn Undead: </h4>
<h4>As an action you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. 
Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. 
If the creature fails its saving throw it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. 
It also can’t take reactions. For its action it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. 
If there’s nowhere to move the creature can use the Dodge action.</h4>

<h4>Additionally starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, 
the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.</h4>

<h4>L10) Divine Intervention: </h4> 

<h4>Your god/goddess has noticed your faith and loyalty to their cause and you can now call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. 
If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. 
The DM chooses the nature of the intervention like the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. 
If they dont intereven then you can use this ability again after you finish a long rest.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Simple Character Ideas you can use: </h4>

<h4>You are a cleric of the sun god who destroys all evil with his holy light through his followers. 
You have chosen to become one of these followers to destroy eveil. 
So with your gods support you set off into the world to erraticate eveil and bring places of darkness into the light. </h4>

<h4>You have served the goddess of the dead loyally for your entire life. 
At the end of your life your goddess spoke to you and made you an offer, 
serve her after death to stop those messing with the balance between life and death and she would grant you life once more. 
You accepted without hesitation the opportunity to serve your goddess again and so quite hypocritically 
you were revived so that you could stop others from upsetting the natural order between life and death.</h4>

<h4>You were raised in a temple and were taught the god of life loved all of theyre crations. They they wished them no harm and only wanted for peace. 
But your order knew that for ultimate peace to be achived that some would have to sacrifice themselves and do what was necessary. 
You were one of those few, you trained to adventure the world so that you could stop those doing harm even if it meant you had to do harm yourself. 
It was all in the name of peace after all, wasnt it? 
In truth without your knowing you were raised in a cult but you dont know that yet. How you react to this and what will be the truth you discover is your story to tell</h4>
