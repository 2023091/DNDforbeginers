<h4>Hello and welcome to D&D Classes for beginners. This site will help you with learning to play dnd as a player which will include universal actions like dash and hide, the diffrent classes,
 a few subclasses for each, leveling for each class and a few ideas for characters for each class. </h4>
<br>

<h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>

<h4>When you reach 4th level in any class you get something called an Ability Score Improvment or ASI for short. You also again an ASI at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level.
An ASI lets you increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. 
As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</h4>

<h4>Using the optional feats rule you can instead of taking this feature take a feat of your choice instead. 
Feats let you gain new skills, passive or acive features or possibly new actions.</h4>

<h4>Lets start with the basics before we get into classes with the diffrent actions you can take in combat:</h4>
  
<h4>Dash: </h4>
  <h4>Will double your movement speed for that turn. This is useful if your enemies are far away, 
  you need to get away from an enemy fast or if there is difficult terrain slowing you down.</h4>
 
  <h4>Disengage: </h4>
    <h4>Allows you to get away from an enemy your standing next to without allowing them to trigger 
    an opportunity attack against you. It is useful to take when you need to escape from a stong enemy you cant risk taking a hit from. </h4>

  <h4>Hide: </h4>
  <h4>Allows you to attempt to hide from the enemies line of sight if your behind cover. 
    Remember however that this is not a video game and so you must actually hide from the enemy before you take this action. 
    Hiding does give you advantage on your attack rolls for weapons and spells and it might allow you to 
    sneak away from an enemy to escape or to gain a better positioning.</h4>

  <h4>Attack: </h4>
<h4>The attack action is when you would like to attempt to hit an enemy with your weapon, 
this includes any simple or martial melee weapon like a sword, dagger, rapier or a ranged weapon like a bow, crossbow or sling. 
To hit an enemy you must roll a to hit roll using your weapon hit modifier which can be calculated 
by adding your Str or Dex plus your proficiency modifier as long as you are proficient with the weapon.</h4>
  
  <h4>Cast Spell: </h4>
<h4>To cast a spell you must first fufil the requierments of the spell. There are three things to fufil for a spell:</h4> 
<h4>Verbal components which means you must be able to speak a magic word.</h4>
<h4>Somatic components means you must be able to move your hands to cast the spell.</h4>
<h4>Material components means you need an item to cast the spell. 
  Some spell materials can be ignored by having an arcane focus like a wand or a staff,
  but if the item has an associated cost (eg. Diamond worth 100gp) then you will require the item even with an arcane focus.</h4>
  
  <h4>Use Item: </h4>
<h4>Using an item like a potion, a magic swords effect or interacting with something like a lever requires an action to do unless stated diffrently by your dm. </h4>
  
  <h4>Ready: </h4>
<h4>To ready an action means you are taking one of the other actions listed, but you are holding it until a specific condition is met. For instance: </h4>
 <h4>"I'm going to cast fire ball once my allies have moved away from the enemy."</h4>
  <h4>This is useful when you want to do something but the conditions are not sutiable on your turn perhapse requiring the help of an ally or for the enemy to do something.</h4>
  
  <h4>Help: </h4>
  <h4>The help action is used to aid an ally in an action they’re taking. 
    Their next roll to do an action they are taking is done with advantage or you could use the help action to aid an ally in attacking an enemy you are within 5 feet of. 
    Their next attack on that target is rolled with advantage as long as it is done before the start of your next turn. </h4>
	
	<h4>Now that you understand the basics of actions you can take in combat no matter your class you will now be able to choose a class below and I will go into more detail to that specific class. 
	Note that these are not all of the available classes in dnd5e but these will give you a wide selection to choose from for beginners. 
	I will be covering each of them up to level 10, to  see more please resort to the players manual.</h4>
