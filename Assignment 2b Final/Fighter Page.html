<h4>So you wish to be a master of the blade? Or maybe the axe or bow is what you fancy? Doesnt matter the fighter is here for you to be the master of any weapon you wish.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Lets go over the base features of the fighter that you will recive at level 1: </h4>

<h4>Hit Points: </h4>
<h4>1d10 per level is what youll need as the fighter, 
charging into the front lines sword in hand youll need to take as well as you give.</h4>

<h4>Saves: </h4>
<h4>Strength and Constitution are your best saving throws, 
these let you shrug off enemies trying to grapple you or trying to hurt you with poison for example.</h4>

<h4>Proficiencies: </h4>
<h4>As a fighter you are able to master any weapon you like with proficency in all simple and martial weapons. 
Like wise you can wear light and simple leather armour or a heavy and strong set of plate armour with your proficency in light, medium and heavy armour and shields as well.
Finally you can choose two skills to be proficent with.</h4>

<h4>Fighting style is a way for you to decide what kind of fighter your fighter is. 
You can choose 1 fighting style to give you a buff either to your use of a weapon or to help you defend yourself or your allies.</h4>

<br>

<h4>L1) stands for the level you unlock this so L1) means level 1</h4>

<h4>L1) Second Wind: </h4>
<h4>The first ability of the fighter, on your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. 
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</h4>

<h4>L2) Action Surge: </h4>
<h4>You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. 
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</h4>

<h4>L3) Martial Archetype: </h4>

<h4>When hitting level three you select your subclass, Fighter subclasses are called Martial Archetypes. 
These let you decide how you want your fighter to focus theyre talents wether it is with a sword like a samurai or knight, 
or maybe you want to create a ghost like echo of yourself to have your own back. 
Martial Archetypes are the way to focus your skills and really make yourself stand out.</h4>

<h4>Echo Knights can summon an echo of themselves to fight alongside you in combat. 
Why rely on a wild and crazy barbarian or a cunning and mischievous rouge to have your back when you can have your own back.</h4>

<h4>Samurais are capable and resilient, the Samurai is capable of sudden bursts of incredible power 
but is also able to be calm and do well in social interactions where his fellow fighter bretheren might struggle more.</h4>

<h4>Arcane Archers gain the ability to enchant and fire magic arrows in battle to add some range to theyre arsenal. 
Choose from a list of magical effects like banashing your enemies to another plane for a short amount of time or shooting an arrow that can temporarily blind your enemies making them easy targets for a second shot. 
They also gain some proficency in either arcana or nature letting them be a bit more useful outside of battle.</h4>

<h4>Eldritch Knights complement your phenomenal martial prowess with magic to defend yourself and to strike at your foes. 
You gain the ability to cast spells from the wizards spell list being able to defend yourself with spells like shield or attack with magic missle. 
Lastly you can bind your weapon magically too you making it impossible to disarm you unless you are incapacitated 
and you are able to summon it to you no matter how far away it is for a bonus action as long as it is on te same plane as you.</h4>


<h4>L4) Ability Score Improvment: </h4> 

<h4>When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, 
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. 
As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</h4>

<h4>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead. 
As a fighter you get far more ability score Improvments than any other class which can be a huge help in making you stronger with feats and stat increases.</h4>

<h4>L5) Extra Attack: </h4>

<h4>You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.</h4>

<h4>L6)Indomitable: </h4>

<h4>Now you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. 
If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Simple Character Ideas you can use: </h4>

<h4>A nobles son who has trained with the blade for years for his parents approval but never got it 
so now you travel the world hoping to get good enough to earn theyre respect.</h4>

<h4>A ex solider solider from a nation that decided they were sick of guarding the same streets each day and wanted to see the world. 
So they signed up to become an adventurer and have set out to start theyre new life.</h4>
