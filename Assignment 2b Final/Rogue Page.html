<h4>So living life inside the law doesnt suit you aye? 
Then why not live outside the law, take what you want when you want 
and only ever feel bad when you get caught and need to lie your way out of it. 
Lets teach you the ways of stealth and crime with the Rogue.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Lets go over the base features of the rogue that you will recive at level 1: </h4>

<h4>Hit Points: </h4>
<h4>1d8 per level is a little small for a martial class but I assure you once you gain a few levels 
you'll be harder to kill than even the most muscular of barbarians.</h4>

<h4>Saves: </h4>
<h4>Dexterity and Intelligence are your best saving throws, 
these let you dip and dive out of the way of enemiey attacks or if they try to use magic on your mind but watch out incase they are trying to hurt you with poison.</h4>

<h4>Proficiencies: </h4>
<h4>As a quick and stealthy rogue you are proficent in light armour, simple weapons, 
hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords, thieves’ tools and two skills. 
Everything a rogue needs to sneaking in and sneak out without anyone alive to tell the tale.</h4>

<h4>Expertise is a fantastic way to be even better at what your good at as it lets you choose 2 of your proficent skills and add your proficency modifier twice to it. 
You also gain 2 more expertise at level 6.</h4>

<h4>Thieves’ Cant is a secret language between criminals you learned during your rogue training. 
A secret mix of dialect, jargon and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. 
Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. 
It does take four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly 
so its best used for exchanging basic information and setting up meeting points that are safe to talk freely.

You also understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, 
simple messages such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, 
whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</h4>

<br>

<h4>L1) stands for the level you unlock this so L1) means level 1</h4>

<h4>L1) Sneak Attack: </h4>
<h4>You've learned to exploit distraction and moments of opportunity to strike subtly and at weak points in the enemies armour. 
Once per turn you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. 
The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it and that enemy isn’t incapacitated and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table in the players handbook.</h4>

<h4>L2) Cunning Action: </h4>
<h4>Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quicker than your fellow adventurers. 
As a bonus action on each of your turns in combat you can take the 
Dash, Disengage, or Hide actions as a bonus action instead but only once per turn. </h4>

<h4>L3) Roguish Archetype: </h4>

<h4>When hitting level three you select your subclass, rogue subclasses are known as archetypes 
and these let you decided which type of criminal you are and let you become even better in your field.</h4>

<h4>Arcane Trickster lets use illusions and enchantments to confuse and outsmart your foes, tricking them by becoming invisible, 
seeing doubles with you and charming them into giving you the password instead of having to force it out of them. </h4>

<h4>Assassins are masters of infiltration, disguise, and dealing high-damage sneak attacks at the beginning of combat. 
If you want to be able to kill your enemies with a single shot while you hide in plain sight then assassin might be for you.</h4>

<h4>Thief is the iconic rogue, the thief is a master of using tools and items (including magic items) to overcome challenges quickly. 
Your also a master of getting into places your not supposed to and locked doors are barely and inconvenience for you. 
If you want to get your greedy little hands on everything then pick the thief, just dont go looking at your allies items.</h4>

<h4>Swashbucklers are the charismatic master duelists of the sea. Swashbucklers use their Charisma in unique ways both in and out of combat and are masters at engaging foes one-on-one. 
So while you dont have to be a pirate, who doesnt want to have a parrot on one shoulder and a chest of gold under theyre boot.</h4>

<h4>L5) Uncanny Dodge: </h4>

<h4>Another of your many skills to stay alive, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</h4>

<h4>L7)Evasion: </h4>

<h4>Here to help you avoid those large area attacks, you can now nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, 
such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. 
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, 
you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Simple Character Ideas you can use: </h4>

<h4>An orphan that didnt have much growing up, but when you fell into the wrong crowd you suddenly started to have a lot more. 
Growing up with crime its basically in your blood now and you'll do anything for a bit of coin, even a few quests if the pay is good enough.</h4>

<h4>You were raised in a family of assassins, each one having killed at least a hundred people whether they were commoners or kings. 
You were trained by them with great expectations placed on you, 
finally you were sent into the world and told not to come back until you thought yourself worthy of being a true member of this family.</h4>

<h4>You were a good man before, a humble store owner. But when your wife got sick you had to sell everything to try and pay for a cleric to save her. 
But it wasnt enough. So you had to resort to crime to try and earn enough, 
so you joined a gang of criminals who were planning a heist and right at the end of the job they betrayed you letting you be the fall guy. 
With your name ruined you were forced to leave while your wife slowly died in her bed. You now have too goals, 
revenge on the ones who tricked you and getting enough money to pay for a cleric to heal your wife so you can run away together and be happy again. </h4>
