<h4>So you dont want to work for your power but you wernt born with any, well why let that get in the way! 
When you have a perfectly good soul you can trade for power its not out of reach. 
So say your prayers, summon a devil or whatever suits your fancy and lets make you a warlock.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Lets go over the base features of the fighter that you will recive at level 1: </h4>

<h4>Hit Points: </h4>
<h4>1d8 per level is decent for a caster like the warlock, 
but dont go thinking your immortal for a second or youll be losing that soul you just traded before you know it.</h4>

<h4>Saves: </h4>
<h4>Wisdom and Charisma are your best saving throws, 
which are good for resisting spells and magic effects but not so good for falling rocks and poison</h4>

<h4>Proficiencies: </h4>
<h4>As a warlock you are proficent with light armour only so youll be easy enough to hit 
and being proficent with only simple weaons means range and magic are your bread and butter. 
You can also choose two skills to be proficent is as well to help you in your adventures.</h4>

<h4>Otherworldly Patrons are who you have struck a bargain with to attain this magical power you now wield and this is how you choose your subclass. 
An otherworldly being of your choice can be your patron such as: </h4>

<h4>The Fiend which is a devil of Avernus that you signed a contract with for your magic. I wont question what deal you made but I can tell you that the destructive fire power they offer can be worth it.</h4>

<h4>The Genie (and no not the aladin kind) is a strong elemental being that offers you diffrent magical powers depending on which element you choose between earth, fire, water and air.</h4>

<h4>The Archfey is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. They let you charm and trick your enemies with theyre fey magic.</h4>

<h4>No matter which you choose whether its one of these examples or another your choice will grant you features at levels 1, 6, 10 and 14. </h4>

<h4>Pact Magic </h4>

<h4>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. You cast your spells using your charisma modifier.</h4>

<h4>Cantrips are the lowest level spell and as such can be casted an infinite amount of times. 
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list at level 1. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels.</h4>

<h4>Spell Slots</h4>

<h4>The Warlocks are very diffrent from other spell casters as theyre spells are always cast at the highest level you are able to cast at. 
This means that you will cast a 1st level spell with a 3rd level spell slot for example, this could make the spells effect more powerful. 
You are however un-able to cast as many spells as other spell casting classes only having 2 spell slots up until 11th level,
but you do regain all of your spell slots on a short rest unlike other spellcasters so this helps you to make up for your lack of spell slots.</h4>

<br>

<h4>L1) stands for the level you unlock this so L1) means level 1</h4>

<h4>L2) Eldritch Invocations: </h4>

<h4>You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. 
Eldritch invocations are great magical ways to customise your warlock with examples being able to read all languages, empowering your eldritch blast, or beaing able to sense all magic within 30 feet of you. 
When you gain certain warlock levels you gain additional invocations of your choice as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table in the players handbook. 
Additionally when you gain a level in warlock you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level. 
If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. </h4>

<h4>L3) Pact Boon: </h4>
<h4>Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. 
You gain one of the following features of your choice.</h4>

<h4>L2) Action Surge: </h4>
<h4>You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. 
On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action. 
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</h4>


<h4>Pact of the Blade: </h4>

<h4>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. 
You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. 
You are proficient with it while you wield it. 
This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. 
Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. 
It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.
You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. 
You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour which can be done during a short rest. 
You can then dismiss the weapon putting it into an extradimensional space and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. 
You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. 
The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, 
or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. 
The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</h4>

<h4>Pact of the Chain: </h4>

<h4>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. 
The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. 
When you cast the spell you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms, imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. 
Additionally when you take the Attack action you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.</h4>

<h4>Pact of the Tome: </h4>

<h4>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. 
When you gain this feature you choose 3 cantrips from any class’s spell list (the 3 dont need to be from the same list). 
While the book is on your person you can cast those cantrips at will. 
They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. 
If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list they are nonetheless warlock spells for you. 
If you lose your Book of Shadows you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. 
This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest and it destroys the previous book. 
The book turns to ash when you die. </h4>

<h4>L) Mystic Arcanums: </h4>

<h4>Excluding features from your subclass at levels 11, 13, 15 and 17 
your patron will bless you with a more powerful spell of a higher level which you can cast once per long rest without using a spell slot.</h4>

<br>

<h4>Simple Character Ideas you can use: </h4>

<h4>An earth genasi woman who grew up an orphan after their fathers death is visited on theyre 20th birthday by her estranged 
dao (earth genie) mother who offers their child a portion of theyre magic for a birthday present in exchange for earning them gold to add to theyre fortune. 
The woman with no other idea of what to do with theyre life and with the hop of getting to know their mother accepts the gift.</h4>

<h4>A young boy whos mother was on the brink of death was visited by a stranger one day who said he could heal the boys mother. 
Without asking questions the young boy immediatly accepted the strangers help. 
The mother got better but then the boy felt a burning on his hand as a tattoo appears, the mark of servitude to a devil. 
Now the young boy is all grown up and a servant to theyre patron, 
but theyre wish to break free so that they can just spend theyre days peacfully with theyre mother. </h4>

<h4>A young girl who was given to a hag in a deal by her parents is trained in the ways of magic by the hag. 
The hag decides to give her a portion of her power and sets her fourth to the material plane to cause chaos and send some people her way to make more deals with her</h4>
